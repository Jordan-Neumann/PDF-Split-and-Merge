# PDF-Splitter
I build this PDF splitter to assist with one of my current projects.  The project requires obtaining specific page ranges of a large PDF document.  View the code in action here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C38ecJLSb8

To use for yourself, make sure to save the PDF you intend to split in your current working directory.
